two syntax => scss => saccy css => superset of css => scss file extension
sass => uses indentation
css variables
:root{
    --text-clr: black;
}
sass variable => $text-clr: black
sass variable on compilation will replace the value with the variable. so it is 100% browser compatible.
sass maps => $font: (
    small: 8px;
    regular: 10px;
    large: 14px;
)
to use map => map-get($font, small)

partial => scss file begins with underscore and compiler wont convert it into css
@import 'reset' => imports partial _reset.scss file

functions => similar to js functions
@function weight($sizename){
    @return map-get($font, $sizename)
}

mixins => repeated properties can be combined and used as mixins
@mixin flexCenter(){
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
p{
    @include flexCenter
}
@extend .classname => will include all the style in that class
p{
    @extend .classname => it will include all the style in the classname
}
