Jasmine => it is a js unit testing tool, it is run by nodejs, so it lacks testing DOM things
So it uses Karma, to do DOM testing.
it runs in browser
Angular cli will build this automatically
Karma is deprecated. It will be replaced by mordern web test runner.

Jest was created by facebook or meta to overcome this. 
Angular cli will provide build for jest
it runs in terminal itself
1)it uses JSDOM a lightweight emulator to create DOM things.
2)It runs tests in parallel
3)only the affected testcases are ran
we need jest-preset-angular to carry out the testcases
