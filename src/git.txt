local repo => 
remote repo =>
modified files

staging area
git add . => adds all file to staging area
git add -p index.html => will add only parts of index.html
commit -m '' -m '' => commit only commits changes to the local repo
git commit -am '' => adds and commits in single line => it commits only modified files and not untracked changes
git push origin master=>origin will be set while cloning the remote repo into local repo
git remote -v => lists all remote repos
if the project is not cloned then we can set remote origin by 
git remote add origin https://github.com/santhosh8299/expense-tracker.git
git push -u origin master => set upstream => once it is set, for future push we can use git push alone
git branch => lists all branches
git checkout -b feature/bug090 => creates new branch and switched to new once.
git diff
git merge 
not needed.. since we will push to remote and merge in the main and then we take pull and update other branches
git log => lists all commits
fork => create a new repo from another existing repo with all the branch details.
merge => fast forward merge where the merging branches will have the same branch history
merge commit where the two branches changes are merged in a commit. it happens automatically on merge.

undo changes
git reset => undo all staged files to working directory
git reset HEAD~1 => HEAD here points to current commit. HEAD~1 points to one commit before. 
it will undo last commit and changes in the last commit will move to working directory => it will unstaged and uncommitted
git reset commithash => will undo the stage and commit but the changes will be in working directory.
git reset --hard commit => will completely remove the changes even from the working directory.
git merge --abort => undo recent merge
