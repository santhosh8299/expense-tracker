Ecma script is specification => js is browser implementation of ecmascript
in 2015 es2015 or es6 is introduced. after that early release happened 
use transpilers(babel) which supports old browser version by transpiling es6 to es5 code.
Js => prototype based object oriented programming model.
c++/java => classical object oriented programming model.

Typescript has modifiers
public, private, protected
const map = new Map([[1,2],[3,4]])
map retains the order in which it is inserted but not objects
array => for of
objects => for in
promise vs callbacks => handle error in one place. neat and understandable code

es5 itself doesn't have any module loading system so a community developed commonjs 
es6 introduced import syntax but js engine haven't implemented it yet.
/// <reference path="angular.d.ts" /> is a special comment
recognized by TS, telling the compiler to look for the interface
angular.d.ts. 

web based components => it will have shadow dom
angular inspired to use web based components and to convert angular components to web based components using angular elements

tsconfig.json => contains info about compilation
package.json => contains info about npm commands
angular.json => contains angular cli configuration
launch.json => used for debugging. click on vs code debug icon and click run ng serve. 
it will launch app in debugger mode.
commonmodule => most commonly used pipes and directives are declared in this module. thats y it is imported automatically by cli.
 
ng serve => cli bundles all our ts files to js file and insert as script tag in html with the help of webpack.

interpolation => {{}} => converts everything to string => evaluate every expression.
The interpolation we had above to display the user’s name:
<p>{{ user.name }}</p>
is just sugar syntax for the following:
<p [textContent]="user.name"></p>

Angular will maintain the properties and attributes in sync.
the value attribute will always contain 'hello', whereas the value property
of the DOM node is dynamically modified by the browser, and thus contains whatever the user has entered in the text field.

properties can have boolean values, whereas some attributes can only reflect it by being present or absent on the
start tag. For example, you have the selected attribute on the <option> tag: no matter what value you give it, it will select the
option, as long as it is present.

property binding directly deals with the properties
 access nested properties like style.color
 [style.color]="expression" => evaluated on every change detection cycle

eventbinding
(click)="statement;statement" statement can be a function call. called when the event is emitted.

<ng-template [ngIf]="races.length > 0">
<div><h2>Races</h2></div>
</ng-template>
<div *ngIf="races.length > 0"><h2>Races</h2></div>
* indicates structural directive

<ul>
<li *ngFor="let race of races; index as i">{{ i }} - {{ race.name }}</li>
</ul>
index is a exported variable in the directive
other exported variables are even odd first last

<p [style.color]="foreground">Friendship is Magic</p>
<div [ngStyle]="{fontWeight: fontWeight, color: color}">I've got style</div>
Note that the directive expects an object whose keys are the styles to set. The keys can either be in camelCase (fontWeight) or
in dash-case ('font-weight').

<div [class.awesome-div]="isAnAwesomeDiv()" [class.wonderfuldiv]="isAWonderfulDiv()">I've got style</div>
<div [ngClass]="{'awesome-div': isAnAwesomeDiv(), 'wonderful-div':
isAWonderfulDiv()}">I've got style</div>

@input('htmlname') name
@input()
set name(value: string){

}
@Output() readonly ponySelected = new EventEmitter<PonyModel>();

style encapsulation
1)shadow dom
<ns-pony>
#shadow-root (open)
<style>.red {color: red}</style>
<div class="red">Rainbow Dash</div>
</ns-pony>
styles are included inside the shadow root itself.
2)Emulated
Angular takes component css and inline it inside head section
while adding it rewrite the css selector name as well as it adds same attribute to all the nodes within the component
<head>
<style>.red[_ngcontent-dvb-3] {color: red}</style>
</head>
<body>
...
<ns-pony _ngcontent-dvb-2="" _nghost-dvb-3="">
<div _ngcontent-dvb-3="" class="red">Rainbow Dash</div>
</ns-pony>
3) None => they inline into head style section but without rewriting(global styles)

pipe
pipe can be used in interpolation and binding expressions and not in event statements
<div *ngFor="let pony of ponies | slice : 0 : 2 as total; index as i">
{{ i + 1 }}/{{ total.length }}: {{ pony.name }}
</div>

keyvalue pipe automatically sorts based on number or string, if mixed it converts it to string and then it will sort
<!-- entry contains { key: number, value: PonyModel } -->
<li *ngFor="let entry of ponies | keyvalue">{{ entry.key }} - {{
entry.value.name }}</li>

number & percent pipe => {integerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}
in pipe input should be given in order as the pipe function expects
{{ 10.6 | currency:'EUR':'symbol':'.2' }}

pure pipe => default => it runs only when its input value or reference change => single instance
@pipe({
    name: '',
    pure: true
})

Dependency injection => some part might require some other part 
instead of creating that Dependency by ourself, we let framework create for use
Inversion of control
singleton pattern

injection token along with provider
export const BACKEND_URL_PROVIDED = new InjectionToken<string>('API URL', {
providedIn: 'root',
factory: () => 'http://localhost:8080'
});

guards and interceptors are functions in angular 14,15
so inject() is used for di in those

http
it is optional and not included by default
we need to add by provideHttpClient in config.ts
observables returned are cancellable, retry , and composable
the response returned is deserialized automatically by angular.
while calling post also we dont need to searialize the payload, angular will do that for us.
httpclient has an optional obj, we can modify the req and response there.

httpContext => we can send a context along with the request. that context can be used in interceptors
const context = new HttpContext().set(SHOULD_NOT_HANDLE_ERROR, true);
return http.get(`${baseUrl}/api/users`, { context });

export const errorHandlerInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (
req: HttpRequest<unknown>,
next: HttpHandlerFn
): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> => {
const router = inject(Router);
const errorHandler = inject(ErrorHandler);
// if there is a context specifically asking for not handling the error, we don't
handle it
if (req.context.get(SHOULD_NOT_HANDLE_ERROR)) {
return next(req);
}
return next(req).pipe(

interceptor (req,next)
const reqn = req.clone()
return next(reqn) to modify the request we should clone and modify
next(req).pipe()=> to handle the response

Router
Router is also optional. Hence we need to provide in app.config
provideRouter(routes)
router-outlet => placeholder for the component corresponding to the current route
routerLink & routerLinkActive
router & ActivatedRoute => contains snapshot and parammap observable
path matching strategy => default prefix so for '' every path will match that's y we give full
Guards => canactivate, candeactivate, canactivatechild, canmatch
canmatch => same path name different components, can match will decide which component to load.
export const loggedInGuard: CanActivateFn = (
_route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
_state: RouterStateSnapshot
): boolean | UrlTree => {
const userService = inject(UserService);
const router = inject(Router);

RESOLVER => normally onclick of a button, router will change the url and corresponding component will 
start loading, the api will be called and the data is shown, if error occurs in api, error will be handled in new page.
But with resolver, all the api calls happen first before the router change the page, if the api calls succeeds, then it will
navigate to the new page.
{
path: 'races/:raceId',
component: RaceComponent,
resolve: {
race: raceResolver
}
export const raceResolver: ResolveFn<RaceModel> = (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot):
Observable<RaceModel> => {
const id = route.paramMap.get('raceId')!;
const raceService = inject(RaceService);
return raceService.get(id);
};

Router events
navigationStart => click on a link
navigationEnd => successfully navigated to a new page
navigationCancel => cancelled by guards
navigationError => when resolvers emit empty or error observable

matrix params => /races/42;foo=bar;baz=wiz/ponies
specific to a route, it is accessible only form races/42 route segment
router.navigate(['/races', 42, { foo: 'bar', baz: 'wiz' }, 'ponies']);

query params => accessble throughout the route segments
router.navigate(['/races', 42, 'ponies'], { queryParams: { foo: 'bar', baz: 'wiz' }
});

provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding())
since angular 16, component can declare input same as route param, then angular will automatically bid the value
@Input({ required: true }) raceId!: string

Lazy loading
lazy loading all admin related routes
declare all admin related routes in admin.route.ts file and declare
{
    path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('/admin/admin.route')
}
lazy load only one component then
{
    path: 'admin', loadComponent: () => import('/admin/admin.component')
}

FORMS
input.ng-invalid.ng-dirty {
border: 3px red solid;
}
angular will add ng-invalid etc classes based on the state of the form automatically
ng-pending is dynamically added to the field while the asynchronous validator
forms are typed from angular 14
custom control => implement controlvalueaccessor
writevalue
registerOnchange
registerOntouched
setdisabledstate
providers: [
{
provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
useExisting: forwardRef(() => RatingComponent),
multi: true
}
]
view child query will have upto date value all the time
static: true makes view child works inside ngoninit but it is not intended to
viewchildren returns querylist it has many methods, first last length changes map filter toArray

content projection
<ng-content select=".title"></ng-content>
</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<ng-content select=".content"></ng-content>

<ns-card>
<p class="title">Card <strong>title</strong></p>
<p class="content">Some quick <strong>example</strong> text</p>
</ns-card>
it lacks the ability to add context(dynamic values) in the projected content
for that we can use templateref => which can have dynamic values of the current component

<ng-template #myFormatter let-p="percentage"><strong>Your</strong> progress: {{ p |
number }}%</ng-template>
through let-p it can have dynamic values from the new component as well
Angular defines a micro-syntax for structural
directives
<ng-template ngFor [ngForOf]="ponies" let-pony let-i="index">
<div>{{ i }} - {{ pony }}</div>
</ng-template>
 *ngFor="let pony of ponies; i as index">

 hostlistener
 @HostListener('dblclick',['$event'])//we can access the event as well
clearContent(): void {
this.element.nativeElement.value = '';
}
@HostBinding('value') innerValue;
everytime the innervalue changes, it updates the host value property

@HostBinding('class.is-required')
get isRequired(): boolean {
return this.control.hasError('required');
}
everytime the directive is used in the form this get method will run
in directive constructor we can access elementref ngControl and other instances used in the host element

Modules
when standalone and modules are used together, standalone components should be considered as separate module
they need to be in the imports of the module
single component angular modules(SCAMs) which leads to standalone components

Performances
first load, reload, runtime Performance
first load => assets, bundling, treeshaking, minified and dead code elimination(Terser), assets are compressed and gzipped, lazy loading, subscribe
reload => caching => configured on the server cachecontrol and etag headers
hash code will be attached to the bundled file names. cache busting
runtime => trackby, onpush

ChangeDetectorRef
detach()
detectChanges()
markForCheck()
reattach()
start(): void {
this.ref.detach();
this.interval$.subscribe(time => {
    this.time = time;
// manually trigger the change detection every second
if (this.time % 1000 === 0) {
this.ref.detectChanges();
}
});

this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
this.chart = new Chart(ctx, {
type: 'bar',
data: {
labels: ['Green', 'Red'],
datasets: [{ label: 'Score', data: [12, 21] }]
}
});
});

pure pipes => will execute only when input ref to the transform function changes.
@input => will be checked everytime for change
@Attribute => its like one time thing and angular does not check for changes.

SIGNALS => different way for handling reactivity (synchronous)
const total = computed(() => count() * untracked(() => multiplier()));
if we want to exclude a signal from computing total computed signal we can use untracked function
const a =signal().asReadOnly() makes it readonly signal
signal has set, update, mutate methods

const effectRef: EffectRef = effect(() => console.log(this.count()));
// stop executing the effect
effectRef.destroy();

effect(
() => {
if (this.count() > 10) {
this.count.set(0);
}
},
{ allowSignalWrites: true }
);
without allow signalwrites it creates an infinite loop

const user = signal(
{
id: 1,
name: 'Cédric'
},
{ equal: (previousUser, newUser) => previousUser.id === newUser.id }
);
// upperCaseName will not re-evaluate when the user changes if the ID stays the
same
const uppercaseName = computed(() => user().name.toUpperCase());
pass ValueEqualityFn to the signal function, Object.is() is default to check whether signal changes or Not
inorder to run effect or computed.

in onpush change detection components in addition to 
input change, async pipe, browser events in the component, signal change is also included

rxjs and signal can be converted to one another
@angular/core/rxjs-interop

configuration
budget, outputhashing, file replacements,sourcemap
